**SINGLY LINKED LIST**

The Singly Linked List is a data structure that represents a sequence of nodes, where each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. It is commonly used in computer science and programming due to its efficient insertion and deletion operations at the beginning or end of the list.
